# Code Reference for ARTD252 @ The University of Oregon
This repository will offer support for students enrolled in the Winter and Fall terms of ARTD252 at the University of Oregon. I will be hosting in-person sessions for students to ask questions and guidance to the functionality of their code for each project of the class. 

The files in the repository will align with the 10-week coursework for the term. Examples of primary functions used for sketches in the Processing IDE can be referenced here.
